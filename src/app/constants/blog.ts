    "After participating in Taboola's bootcamp, what are the practices I apply in my everyday work.",
  markdownFile: `Last month, I had the opportunity to visit Bangkok for the first time. The reason was because of the first Publisher Professional Service (PubPS) APAC Bootcamp. All the Solution Engineers within different APAC countries (Japan, China, Taiwan, etc.) met in the Taboola Bangkok Office for a week of training and learning. This event allowed me to learn new Taboola products and different techniques. However, with how the Japanese market is unique, applying the same styles is not an option. I needed to make some adjustments. The following post explains the new techniques I applied after boot camp.

![bootcamp sample image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5622AQFtDpkPN-RHag/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1720014660114?e=1725494400&v=beta&t=LPcsPjmTll3oJg_JpPagICPz_nlu43egO9-po8_2Kuc)

#### Emphasis On Professional Relationship

Currently, I am the only “technical” position located locally for the Japanese market. The remaining local employees are more business centered. Thus, it is easy to stick out as I have different responsibilities and KPIs compared to others. Paul Mark's seminar taught me about having a balanced relationship with other departments. Right now, I place a stronger emphasis on having a professional relationship with the business team. This means minimizing unnecessary and non-work related discussions. If everyone else is planning an internal event, assume that I am not part of it. Instead, I prioritize the work requested by other departments and teams.

#### Sell Yourself For Every Opportunity

Compared to my teammates, I am more of an introvert. As an introvert, I have to work three times as hard to surpass a hard-working introvert. One of the things I am doing more now is to plan “realistic” initiatives. For example, I am currently conducting a mini “tech-talk” in Japanese for the members who may have difficulty with understanding it in English. One topic I presented was basic frontend and backend knowledge.

Another thing I do is try to offer ideas based on the business team’s goals or challenges. For instance, Japanese clients are not as “forgiving” about mistakes. In other words, everything needs to be close to perfection on the first try. Therefore, it is important to offer myself to the business team and offer ideas to minimize the chances of mistakes. For example, I am working with members from other teams to create a checklist to help gather the necessary information to minimize the back and forth between the clients and us.

#### Dedicate Time For Side Topics

One of the goals for the Pub PS is to be “equally aligned” partners with our clients. However, this is a challenge in Japanese culture as the cultural mindset is “clients are above us.” While being equal is impossible, we can still create a minimized distance with our clients. To achieve this, it is important to have knowledge outside our basic responsibilities. This may include other services offered by the company or even the scope of the company, such as Google Analytics, AWS, etc. Currently, I am taking an AWS Solution Architect and Google Ad Manager course on Udemy. From time to time, clients will ask us questions about why Amazon S3 Bucket or Google Analytics is not working as they imagined. While these topics are not directly related to the company, being able to offer suggestions or ideas minimizes the distance between clients.

Now, I understand that not everyone may agree with these practices. Some may think I am undervaluing myself. However, at the end of the day we all have to practice when in Rome. Additionally, having these additional knowledge and skills may benefit me in the future.

    'After working in the professional world, what are advice I have based on my experience.',
  thumbnail: '/image/blog/businessMan.png',
  markdownFile: `Recently, I was talking to my _kouhai_ (junior) about entering the professional world after graduation. We both agreed that this was a big **change**. However, what are the advices we have based on our own experiences. The following are advices I have for new employees based on my three year experience.

### Small Opportunities Are Still Opportunities

When you start off at your new position, your experience point is basically zero. Thus, it is important to level up by doing daily tasks and taking the initiative to do things out of your scope. For example, conducting how Google Analytics works compared to the company product is technically not my responsibility. However, doing these small out of scope activities creates a better image of you within the team. Furthermore, having additional knowledge may benefit you in your future career.

### Co Workers Are Not Your Friends or Family

I entered my professional career with the assumption that I will have a good relationship with my co-workers. For example, Homer Simpson has Lenny and Carl and Masuo Fukuda has Anago-san. However, after working you truly understand why they are called “fiction.”

In reality, you are here to do a “job” and nothing more or less. At the end of the day, your coworkers are not your friends or family. It is important to keep professional boundaries between you and your coworker to keep a steady productivity. Additionally, coworkers are humans at the end of the day. There is a risk of them using the information you shared to **their** advantage. Thus, it is important to create a respectable distance between you and your coworkers. For instance, I eat lunch alone and decline any post-work social event unless it is a special occasion, such as a guest from a different country.

### Find Times To Do Outside Things

When you start a new position or work at a new company, I think most of us are concentrating to prove our self-worth. While this is important, it is equally important to detox and relax. Since avoiding stress is impossible, it is important to de-stress outside or work by having a hobby or interests. For example, I hit the gym before work and on the weekend to ease the mental stress caused by work. Besides the gym, I also sketch comic or anime characters to give non-thinking time. Another activity I recommend is to study or review topics you will not touch at work. For instance, I am studying AWS Cloud Practitioner topics and JavaScript certifications. Not only it is fun for me, but it gives me the opportunity to expand my knowledge for future career purposes.

  markdownFile: `Early last week, I celebrated my one year at Taboola or my first Taboolaversary. During this year, I have sharpened and discovered many things that will help with my career path. The following are some reflections from my first year. 
### Healthy Distance Relationships

Similar to my previous jobs, the word “family” is frequently used in the company. While it is important to be nice and friendly with your peers, it is also important to create a healthy “distance” with your co-workers. In my opinion a “friend” or “family” is someone you can share personal stories with and participate in outside activities. This is something that cannot be done with co-workers as they will take things “out of context” and use it against you or for their benefits. Even a small discussion of what you did over the weekend will be used against you. Thus, it is important to create a respectable distance where it acknowledges others about work and only work.

### Always Prepare For The Worst

We have all heard the common cliche, “Nothing in life will go as planned.” Despite this being a cliche, this statement will summarize my daily tasks as a Solution Engineer. For example, a client can provide details about their website that are completely different from the truth or change their plans which affect yours. Even if things do not go as planned, we can still be mentally and technically prepared for the worst case scenario. Let us take the client not providing every detail. This is usually caused because the client representative is not necessarily tech savvy. Therefore, I should have taken the time to prepare a set of questions for the client to forward to their tech team. Another example is when clients change their plans. Recently, I had a client who said they would be removing the infinite scroll from their site. However, three days later they changed their mind and kept the feature. Luckily, I had my personal doubts and prepared a back up plan for this scenario. While some may perceive this as a negative outlook. 

### Learn And More Importantly, Re-Learn

Looking at my surroundings, I am constantly reminded of the importance of having modesty and meekness. Thus, the one way I do this is to take some time to learn and more importantly, re-learn different things. Currently, I am studying for the AWS Cloud Solution Architect, Mandarin, Python, JavaScript, and weightlifting. Some of these things are work related and some are not. However, learning different things serves as a reminder that there will be others more knowledgeable than you. Therefore, I try to take one hour on the weekdays and two to three on the weekends to learn.
